Brian Kruse
The above r script establishes two normal vectors one with sample 100 mean 50 sd 15
and the other sample 100 mean 1000 and sd 150. In addition, the script establishes exponential vectors sample 100 rate 2 and other sample 100 rate 50.  The script continues with one 1000 iteration loop that contains a bootstrap sample normal vectors for ctl and ctl1 with replacement and bootstrap sample exponential vectors expon and expon1 with replacement

## Including Plots

The following histograms have been included.  They demonstrate the central limit theorem for the normally distibuted ctl and ctl1 and demonstrate a skewed distribution for expon and expon1
